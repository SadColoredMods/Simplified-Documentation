# About

Simplified Open Source is a brand new Baldi open source project that makes everything more optimized and is easy for people to add and change more certain things. As this (might) be the only decompile that's at least mod starter friendly.

# Changes

We've changed about almost everything from the base 1.4.3 decompile base, and here they are:


- Changed all planes into quads.
- Added gravity to the player.
- Added tile lighting. (might get overhauled in the future)
- Some sprites have been tweaked to use a sprite sheet instead.
- Made the hud, environments, and some functions act and look more like in BB+ & BBCR.
- Optimized as much of the normal code from most of the script as possible.
- Removed some useless scripts that don't even get used. (Mainly the Mobile Controls)
- Added a brand new debug mode for when the debug bool is on.
- Completely reworked the item system.
- Added a brand new custom NPC class so it can be easier to add custom NPCs.
