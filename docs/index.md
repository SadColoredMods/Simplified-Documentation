# Baldi's Basics Classic - Simplified Open Source

A decompile originally made just for fun, intended to be a fix for the classic version 1.4.3's many issues and flaws while keeping the normal basic play part of the whole thing. Also aiming to be easier to starter baldi modders and for the ones that want their mod to look like BB+ & BBCR.
